# StrawPoll.me-Bot

### Wait what bot? 

Its a bot for [StrawPoll.me](https://strawpoll.me)

But its not the standard Vote bot. This Bot creates Polls, in fact a lot Polls.

### But why ?

StrawPoll.me is using Id's to save their Polls. They started with Id = 1 and always added +1 for every Poll that got created afterwards. We can access these Polls with [http://www.strawpoll.me/1](http://www.strawpoll.me/1), where 1 Is the ID

The idea here is that there are some coll Poll Numbers to get like 20000000 or 123456789. If we now create 1 Millions Polls we surely have some cool Poll ID's
